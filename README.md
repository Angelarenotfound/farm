Link: https://panel.sillydev.co.uk/account/api

- Create a new apikey and name it whatever you want
- Save the string that start with `pltc_`

## 3. Hosting
You can directly host it on sillydev but I recommend obfuscating code and encoding key

If you want to host the code somewhere else, here a list of host that sillydev.co.uk blacklist:
- [bot-hosting.net](https://bot-hosting.net/) (good hosting, never down, coins are slow)
- [huguitisnodes.host](https://dash.huguitisnodes.host/) (ugly background, weird asf)
